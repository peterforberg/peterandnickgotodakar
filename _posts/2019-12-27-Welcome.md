This is our website
====================
*Peter Forberg*

We have decided to document our time in Senegal with a blog. We know it's been done before, by people who are smarter and better than us, but I spent a lot of time programming this site to look nice using hexo.js, GitHub, and Markdown, and I need to get something out of it. We don't know what we'll post about here. Probably just food Nick likes, poems I find, and...well...I tried to think of a third thing but honestly that's about it.

I don't know how to code well. So don't expect too much. Nick will probably ask me to put in something ridiculous, like animated chihuahua that barks out "NICK" when you click it. I can't do that. I'm only human. And I'm majoring in sociology. Anyways, if there's something you'd particularly like to see on this blog, just send us a message. I'm sure you know how to contact one of us.

This post?

It's mostly just a way to test Markdown
---------------------------------------

Actually, I'm writing it at **four AM** because I want it to go live before we leave on a plane. We haven't even decided on a URL. I don't know how it looks on mobile. See you in the next one. Placeholder text.

If you find any out of place Chinese text please let me know. It's a process.
