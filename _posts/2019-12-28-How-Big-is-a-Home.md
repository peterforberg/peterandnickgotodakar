*Peter Forberg*

Nick is standing 181 inches across from me in our 2 bedroom apartment that we've occupied for the last 6 months. We know the question that anyone who knows us is asking: *what's happening to the brick?* Over the past few days we've packed up our winter gear, sent our intergalactic friend Yubba to the care of another home, and removed the plants from the windowsill. Our little apartment, with its quaint exposed brick, is being left behind.

We've found two subletters, a cheerful German man studying music and a kind Italian doctor. We think we've left the place in good hands, but we will miss Woodlawn while we're in Senegal.

Tonight, we're heading to Chinatown to find gifts for the residents of our new home in Dakar. We have no idea what to get them. Hopefully, they will never read this blog. If you have any idea what a 31 year old Senegalese woman might like as a housewarming gift, please write us.
